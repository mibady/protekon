# Session Log

## Session 0 — 2026-04-01 (Retroactive)

### Prior Work Summary
This project is a redesign/rebuild of Shield CaaS (`/home/info/business/ngeniuspro/shield_caas`).
- 32 pages built (landing, dashboard, auth, solutions, marketing)
- 69 components (13 custom + 56 shadcn/ui)
- 0 API routes, 0 server actions, 0 database tables
- Git history: 26 commits, all on 2026-04-01
- Last commit: "Add README.md" (8728b1d)
- Origin: v0-generated project (protekon-fy)

### Audit Snapshot (Baseline)
| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Pages | 32 |
| API Routes | 0 |
| Components | 69 |
| Server Actions | 0 |
| Supabase Migrations | 0 |
| Inngest Functions | 0 |

### Current State
- **FACE layer:** Complete UI shell — landing page with marketing sections, full dashboard with sidebar nav, auth pages, solutions verticals
- **DNA layer:** Not started — no Supabase, no auth wiring, no API routes
- **HEAD layer:** Not started — no Inngest workflows, no AI features
- All dashboard data is static/placeholder
- Auth pages exist but have no Supabase wiring
- Forms render but don't submit

### Architecture Target (from Shield CaaS)
Must replicate the following from the previous project:
- **Database:** 11+ Supabase tables with RLS (clients, incidents, documents, audits, training_records, etc.)
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth with magic links + password, middleware protection
- **Workflows:** 7 Inngest durable functions (intake-pipeline, monthly-audit, document-generation, incident-report, payment-failed, post-signup, training-reminders)
- **Payments:** Stripe checkout, customer portal, webhooks
- **Email:** Resend for transactional email
- **Storage:** Vercel Blob for generated documents
- **PDF:** pdf-lib for document generation
- **API Routes:** 12 endpoints (inngest, compliance, documents, stripe, upload, etc.)

### Features Complete (UI Only)
1. Landing page with Hero, Pricing, Testimonials, Comparison, SocialProof, CTA
2. Dashboard shell with sidebar navigation
3. Documents hub + request page
4. Incident log + new incident form
5. Reports hub + 6 report sub-pages
6. Regulatory feed page
7. Alerts page
8. Settings page
9. Auth pages (login, signup, forgot-password)
10. Solutions pages (4 verticals: construction, healthcare, real-estate, compliance-suite)

### Features Remaining (Backend-First Workflow)
1. Supabase schema (migrate from Shield CaaS, adapt for new design)
2. Auth wiring (Supabase Auth + middleware + session management)
3. Server actions for all forms (documents, incidents, settings)
4. API routes (compliance score, document download, file upload)
5. Inngest workflows (intake, monthly-audit, doc-gen, incident-report, payment-failed)
6. Stripe integration (checkout, portal, webhooks)
7. Email integration (Resend)
8. Document generation (PDF via pdf-lib + Vercel Blob storage)
9. Dashboard data wiring (replace static data with real queries)
10. Vertical-specific features (construction subs, HIPAA, poster compliance)

### Known Issues
- Hero component had repeated hydration issues (5+ fix commits)
- Package name is generic "my-project" in package.json

### Next Session Should
- /prime to load context
- /plan to design Stage 1: Supabase schema + auth wiring
- Backend-first workflow: database → auth → server actions → API routes → Inngest → Stripe

## Session 1 — 2026-04-01

### Completed
- Project onboarded with /onboard
- Codebase archaeology: analyzed 127 files, 32 pages, 69 components
- Reference project (Shield CaaS) fully analyzed — architecture, schema, Inngest workflows, API routes mapped
- Generated CLAUDE.md with project conventions + architecture target
- Created SESSION_LOG.md with retroactive Session 0
- Linked Vercel project (prj_Fvg5Jz4J1Lkn2lB53rHeKzKtPx8R, team ngenius)
- Pulled 31 env vars from Vercel (.env.local) — Supabase, Inngest, Stripe, Resend, Sanity, Postgres all provisioned
- Git hooks installed (pre-commit + commit-msg)

### Audit Snapshot
| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Pages | 32 |
| API Routes | 0 |
| Components | 69 |
| Server Actions | 0 |
| Supabase Migrations | 0 |
| Inngest Functions | 0 |

### Decisions Made
- Workflow: Backend-first (database → auth → actions → API → Inngest → Stripe)
- Architecture: Replicate Shield CaaS patterns (RLS-first, event-driven via Inngest, vertical multiplexing)
- All backend services pre-provisioned on Vercel (env vars confirmed)

### Known Issues
- Hero component had repeated hydration issues (5+ fix commits in history)
- Package name is generic "my-project" in package.json
- Vercel project domains still show "shield-caas" naming

### Next Session Should
- /prime to load context
- /plan "supabase schema + auth wiring" — Stage 1 of backend-first workflow
- Reference Shield CaaS migrations at `/home/info/business/ngeniuspro/shield_caas/supabase/migrations/`
- Install backend deps: @supabase/ssr, @supabase/supabase-js, inngest, stripe, resend, @vercel/blob, pdf-lib
